jQuery Masonry Image Gallery Plugin for WordPress
===============

Applies jQuery Masonry to native WordPress image galleries. jQuery Masonry is included in WordPress, use it for image galleries. Works best on galleries <strong>without</strong> 1:1 scaled thumbnails.

<strong>Please note:</strong> This plugin will only include 1 line of CSS in your theme. The only CSS injected is the thumbnail width that is taken directly from the Media options page. This will not alter gallery thumbnail styles such as border, padding, etc. This 1 line of CSS helps eliminate image overlap in a responsive theme during window resize.
